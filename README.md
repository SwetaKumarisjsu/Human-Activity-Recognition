# Human_Activity_Recognition

Smartphone has become a necessity in people’s daily life in recent few years. The ability of mobile phones sensors to measure movements, positioning, and orientation of human, 
increases the opportunity to understand these data to enhance our daily lives. To recognize user activity and behavior in real time through smartphone, sensor data is becoming 
extremely useful to various applications in different fields. Biomedical companies can use sensor data to keep track of bio-signals, technological companies can feed news, retail 
companies can use customer behaviors combined with GPS data to guess users propensity to consume. In this project, I have focussed to test different machine learning methods 
to predict different activities that a person executes, based on signals from that person’s smartphone. The input to the learning algorithm is a set of summaries of accelerometer and 
gyroscope signals. The output of the algorithm is a prediction of the activities being performed for the recorded signals. I have reviewed the results by comparing the error rates of different 
feature classification/selection algorithm combinations. I have also conducted error analysis on the most successful learning methods and suggested ways to build from them.st ways to 
build from them.
